Here you'll find some random programming articles on various topics such as python programming tips, web design,  web scraping, working with useful python libraries etc.
Most of the posts will be about solving a well known problem, and some posts on solving problems which are not at all problems.

## About me
I'm a self-taught programmer who :heart: to code.
Most of the times I reimplement the things which I'm fascinated about but also things which I feel can be done better.
I believe that learning stays with you longer when you learn out of necessity and curiosity.
